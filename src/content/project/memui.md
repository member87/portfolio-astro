MemUI was one of the first ever projects I created. You can easily create
good looking user interfaces in Garry's Mod which is notoriously difficult.

Current features:

-   Buttons
-   Rounded Buttons
-   Contianers
-   Headers
-   Context Menu
-   Dropdowns
-   Progress Bars
-   Transitions
-   Scroll Bars
-   Side Navigation Bar
-   Text Entry
-   Top Navigation Bar
