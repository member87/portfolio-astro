This is a website I made to be used in conjunction with my other tool [cam finder](/projects/cam-finder).
It imports all the data from a CSV file and gives you information about each camera found.

The current features include:

1. View all cameras with defualt login details
2. Map showing location of cameras
3. View storage devices connected to the cameras
4. View storage usage (free space, total space, used space)
5. User list (useranme, email, usergroup)
6. Online user list (user account, ip address)
7. Connected camera list (camera name, serial number)
8. View snapshots of cameras
9. Search for specific cameras
