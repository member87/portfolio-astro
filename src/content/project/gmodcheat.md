This is a C++ cheat for the game Garry's mod. It hooks certain game functions
to allow Lua injection.

In addition to Lua injection, it saves all client Lua files to a directory when
you join public servers. Having these files saved lets you read through them
which makes exploting poorly written plugins easier.
