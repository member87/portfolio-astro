Neovim is my text editor of choice. This project is a Lua
config for all my settings and plugins. Some things that
are setup include:

-   LSP (Language Server Protocol)
-   Completion
-   Telescope for fuzzy search and file finding
-   Formatting Tools
-   Copiliot
-   Lazy Plugin Manager
-   Full list on [GitHub](http://github.com/member87/nvim)

There is a build script included written in Python
that will regenerate a readme file to include a list
of all plugins currently in the project.
