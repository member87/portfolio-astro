## Astro Portfolio

This is the third iteration of my personal portfolio, rebuilt using
[Astro](https://astro.build/) for its powerful Static Site Generation (SSG)
capabilities. Astro enables me to deliver lightning-fast performance by shipping
only the essential code to users, minimizing unnecessary JavaScript and
optimizing efficiency.

One of the key improvements in this version is the introduction of a blog
section. Astro's flexible architecture made it an excellent choice for this
feature, providing a seamless writing and publishing experience while
maintaining exceptional speed.

Beyond performance, Astro's component-driven approach and framework-agnostic
nature give me the freedom to integrate various technologies without
compromising efficiency. Whether it's Markdown, MDX, or interactive UI
components, it all works great in Astro.
