This is a simple site I created to view publically available wallpapers
from MKBHD's Panels app. There is a [blog post](/blog/reverse-engineering-panels/) going
into more detail about how I reversed engineered the app to find all
the wallpapers.

The site is hosted at [panels.member87.xyz](https://panels.member87.xyz) and there
is an archive link which can be found on the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/save/https://panels.member87.xyz).
