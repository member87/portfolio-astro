My NextJS portfolio was my second iteration of my personal portfolios.
It is built with NextJS, React, TailwindCSS.

Features:

- Embed GitHub Projects
- Show programming language data directly from GitHub
- Display stars, watchers, etc on my projects.

This portfolio has now been made redundant and replaced by [portfolio-astro](/project/portfolio-astro)
