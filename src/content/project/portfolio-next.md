## Next.js Portfolio (Deprecated)

This was the second iteration of my personal portfolio, built with **Next.js,
React, and Tailwind CSS**. It showcased my projects and GitHub activity
dynamically, providing an interactive and data-driven experience.

### Features

- **Embedded GitHub Projects** – Displayed repositories directly on the site.
- **Real-time Programming Language Data** – Fetched language statistics for each
  project via the GitHub API.
- **Project Metrics** – Showed star count, watchers, and other repository stats.

Although this portfolio served its purpose well, it has since been replaced by
**[portfolio-astro](/project/portfolio-astro)**, which offers improved
performance and a better developer experience.
