My NextJS portfolio was my second iteration of my personal portfolios.
It is built with NextJS, React, TailwindCSS.

Features:

-   Embed GitHub Projects
-   Show programming language data directly from GitHub
-   Display starts, watchers, etc on my projects.

This portfolio has now been made redundant and replaced by [portfolio-astro](/project/portfolio-astro)
